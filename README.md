## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js on Debian 12:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Application Setup

1. Create application directory and set permissions:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/armor
sudo chown startcloud:startcloud /opt/armor
```

2. Create data directory:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /local/www
sudo chown startcloud:startcloud /local/www
```

3. Copy application files:
```bash
sudo cp app.js package.json config.yaml /opt/armor/
sudo chown startcloud:startcloud /opt/armor/*
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd /opt/armor
npm install
```

### Authentication Setup

The application uses a YAML file for user authentication. Edit config.yaml to manage users:
```yaml
users:
  - username: admin
    password: your-secure-password
  - username: user2
    password: another-password
```

### SSL Certificates

The application uses SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt located at:
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/armor.mydomain.net/fullchain.pem`
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/armor.mydomain.net/privkey.pem`

Ensure these certificates are readable by the startcloud user:
```bash
sudo setfacl -R -m u:startcloud:rx /etc/letsencrypt/live/armor.mydomain.net/
sudo setfacl -R -m u:startcloud:rx /etc/letsencrypt/archive/armor.mydomain.net/
```

### Service Setup

1. Copy service file:
```bash
sudo cp armor.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

2. Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable armor
sudo systemctl start armor
```

## Usage

1. Access the server at `https://armor.mydomain.net`

2. Authentication:
   - Click the "Login to Upload" button in the top-right corner
   - Enter your credentials from config.yaml when prompted
   - Once logged in, you'll see a "Logged in" indicator
   - The upload form will appear automatically

3. Directory Navigation:
   - Click folders to navigate into them
   - Use the "Back" button to return to parent directory
   - File paths are shown in the page header

4. File Operations:
   - Click on a file name to download it
   - Authenticated users can upload files using the upload form or drag-and-drop
   - Files are automatically saved to the current directory
   - Checksums are calculated automatically on upload

5. Checksum Features:
   - Checksums are displayed in truncated form (first 8 characters)
   - Hover over a checksum to see the full value
   - Click a checksum to copy it to clipboard
   - A green notification appears when copied successfully

## Service Management

- Check service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status armor
```

- View logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u armor
```

- Restart service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart armor
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If the service fails to start:
   - Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u armor -n 50`
   - Verify Node.js installation: `node --version`
   - Check SSL certificate permissions
   - Verify file permissions in /local/www
   - Ensure startcloud user has necessary permissions

2. If file uploads fail:
   - Verify you are properly authenticated
   - Check directory permissions for startcloud user
   - Check available disk space
   - Ensure the service is running

3. If checksums don't appear:
   - Verify file permissions allow reading
   - Check service logs for errors
   - Ensure file is not corrupted

4. If authentication fails:
   - Verify config.yaml is properly formatted
   - Check config.yaml permissions
   - Ensure credentials are correct
   - Check service logs for auth-related errors
   - Try clearing browser cache and cookies
   - Ensure you're using the correct username/password from config.yaml

## API Documentation

The application provides a comprehensive REST API documented with Swagger UI. Access the interactive documentation at:
```
https://your-domain.com/api-docs
```

### API Authentication

The API supports two authentication methods:
1. **API Keys** - Bearer token authentication (recommended for programmatic access)
2. **JWT Tokens** - Session-based authentication (for web interface)

### API Key Management

Create and manage API keys through the web interface at `/api-keys` or via the API:

```bash
# List your API keys
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/api-keys

# Create new API key
curl -k -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My App","permissions":["downloads","uploads","delete"],"expires_at":"2025-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"}' \
  https://your-domain.com/api/api-keys
```
