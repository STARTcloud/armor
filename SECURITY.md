# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in Armor, please report it responsibly:

### Preferred Method: Security Advisory

1. Go to the [GitHub Security Advisory page](https://github.com/STARTcloud/armor/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with detailed information
4. Submit the advisory

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Affected versions** (if known)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## Response Process

Due to limited development resources, please understand that:

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge receipt within 48-72 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment will be completed within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity, typically 1-4 weeks
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate attention (RCE, privilege escalation)
- **High**: Quick response needed (authentication bypass, data exposure)
- **Medium**: Standard timeline (DoS, information disclosure)
- **Low**: Lower priority (minor information leaks)

## Security Considerations for Armor API

Given that Armor API manages system-level operations on OmniOS, please pay special attention to:

### High-Risk Areas
- **API Key Authentication**: Bypasses or privilege escalation
- **File System Operations**: Path traversal or unauthorized file access
- **Command Execution**: Any potential for command injection

### Configuration Security
- **Default Configurations**: Insecure defaults
- **SSL/TLS Implementation**: Certificate validation, cipher suites
- **CORS Configuration**: Origin validation bypasses
- **Database Security**: SQL injection, unauthorized access

## Best Practices for Users

To maintain security:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always run the latest stable version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow the [security configuration guide](/docs/configuration/)
3. **API Key Management**: Rotate API keys regularly, use strong keys
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS, restrict network access appropriately
5. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for suspicious activity in application logs

## Security Features

Armor API includes several security features:

- **API Key Authentication**: Bcrypt-hashed keys with configurable rounds
- **CORS Protection**: Whitelist-based origin validation
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Configurable HTTPS with custom certificates
- **Input Validation**: Parameter validation and sanitization
- **Audit Logging**: API key usage tracking

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in making Armor API more secure. Responsible disclosure helps protect all users.

### Hall of Fame

Contributors who responsibly report security vulnerabilities will be acknowledged here (with their permission):

- *No vulnerabilities reported yet*

## Updates to This Policy

This security policy may be updated as the project evolves. Check back periodically for changes.
