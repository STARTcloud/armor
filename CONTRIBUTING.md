## Response Times and Review Process

Due to limited development resources:

- **Issue responses**: We aim to acknowledge new issues within a few days
- **Pull request reviews**: Reviews may take weeks depending on complexity and current workload
- **Feature requests**: Prioritized based on community needs and available resources
- **Documentation updates**: Generally reviewed quickly as they're high-impact, low-risk
